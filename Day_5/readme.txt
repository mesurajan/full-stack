Project Objective
Create a fully interactive and visually engaging museum exhibit guide using only HTML5. 
The project must showcase advanced use of HTML5 features, including multimedia, forms, 
semantic elements, and accessibility.

Project Requirements
Home Page:

Include a hero section with an HTML5 <video> background showcasing museum highlights.
Use semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <footer> for proper content structuring.
A navigation menu linking to various sections (e.g., Exhibits, Gallery, Map, Feedback).
Exhibits Section:

Each exhibit should have its own section using <article> and <aside>.
Include multimedia elements:
<audio> descriptions for visually impaired users.
High-quality images using <figure> and <figcaption>.

Interactive Map:

Use the <canvas> element to create a floor map of the museum.
Highlight different sections of the museum with tooltips or 
annotations using <map> and <area> tags.

Gallery Section:

Build a responsive image gallery using <picture> for handling different resolutions.
Provide image details and historical context in <details> and <summary> tags.
Feedback Form:

Design a comprehensive feedback form using <form> and input elements:
Use <input> types like email, date, and range for user inputs.
Include <fieldset> and <legend> for grouping related form controls.
Add <textarea> for detailed feedback and <meter> or <progress> for rating satisfaction.
Accessibility:

Ensure the project meets basic accessibility standards:
Use <aria-label> and <aria-describedby> for screen readers.
Include keyboard navigation hints.
Footer Section:

Add quick links to social media using <a> with descriptive link text.
Display contact details in a structured <address> tag.
Optional Features (Advanced Challenges)
Historical Timeline:

Use <time> and <progress> to create an interactive timeline of the museum's history.
Visitor Stats:

Use <data> and <meter> elements to display visitor statistics (e.g., most visited exhibits).
Embedded PDFs:

Provide downloadable brochures using the <embed> tag.
Virtual Tour:

Use the <iframe> element to embed 360-degree virtual tours.

                Behold the fossilized skeleton of a dinosaur, a creature that roamed the Earth over 
                65 million years ago. Its towering frame and razor-sharp teeth tell the story of 
                a world dominated by these prehistoric titans, whose reign spanned millions of years. 
                Accompanying the skeleton are fossilized footprints and replicas of dinosaur eggs, 
                offering insights into their lives and habitats. This exhibit not only inspires awe 
                but also sheds light on the fragility of ecosystems and the eventual extinction of these giants.

            <h3>The Mummy of Egypt: A Portal to the Past</h3><br>
            <img src="images/exhibits/img2.jpg" style="max-height:200px;max-width:200px;border-radius:15px;">

            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height:1.6;text-align:justify;margin:0;">
                Travel to ancient Egypt and encounter the well-preserved mummy of a pharaoh, a testament to the remarkable 
                embalming techniques of one of the world’s greatest civilizations. This iconic figure, wrapped meticulously 
                in linen, speaks to the ancient Egyptians' belief in the afterlife and their quest for immortality. 
                Surrounding the mummy are ornate sarcophagi, golden amulets, and papyrus scrolls inscribed with hieroglyphs, 
                each unraveling the mysteries of daily life and spiritual practices in Egypt. The exhibit immerses visitors in 
                the grandeur of a civilization that flourished along the Nile.

            <h3>The Mammoth: A Giant of the Ice Age</h3><br>
            <img src="images/exhibits/img3.jpg" style="max-height:200px;max-width:200px;border-radius:15px;">
            <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height: 1.6;text-align:justify;margin:0;">
                The majestic woolly mammoth, with its massive tusks and shaggy coat, is a symbol of survival during the Ice Age, 
                when harsh conditions demanded extraordinary adaptations. Scientists have reconstructed its story from frozen 
                remains found in Siberia, which include remarkably preserved fur, skin, and even stomach contents. Visitors can 
                learn about the mammoth’s role in its ecosystem and its interaction with early humans, who revered it as a source 
                of food and materials. This exhibit reminds us of the intricate connections between species and their environments.

        <h2>Extinct Icons of Nature: A Journey Through Time</h2><br>

        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height: 1.6;text-align: justify;margin: 0;">
        Step into a world of extraordinary creatures that once roamed our planet, shaping ecosystems and inspiring awe. 
        From the majestic saber-toothed tiger to the flightless dodo, each of these species tells a unique story of 
        resilience, adaptation, and, ultimately, extinction. The saber-toothed tiger, with its iconic curved canines, 
        ruled the Ice Age as a powerful apex predator. Larger and more robust than modern big cats, it relied on stealth 
        and strength to hunt massive prey like mammoths. 
        </p><br>
       
        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height: 1.6;text-align: justify;margin: 0;">
        However, the end of the Ice Age and increasing competition with early humans led to its demise, leaving behind 
        fossils that offer vital insights into the evolution of today’s tigers.
        The dodo, native to Mauritius, became a symbol of human-driven extinction. This flightless bird thrived in isolation until 
        the arrival of sailors in the 1600s. Hunting, combined with the introduction of invasive species, devastated the dodo population, 
        and by the late 17th century, it was gone. Its story highlights the fragility of isolated ecosystems and the lasting impact 
        of human activity.

        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height: 1.6;text-align: justify;margin: 0;">
            The ancient ibex, a skilled climber of rugged mountain ranges, adapted to life at high altitudes with its muscular build and 
            backward-curved horns. These creatures not only survived harsh environments but also contributed to ecological balance by shaping
            vegetation patterns. Fossil discoveries remind us of their enduring resilience and the importance of preserving mountain habitats 
            for current wildlife.Together, these creatures represent the intricate balance of life on Earth and the forces that can disrupt it. 
            Their stories not only shed light on the past but also inspire conservation efforts to protect the species that remain today. As 
            we learn from their rise and fall, we are reminded of our responsibility to cherish and safeguard the biodiversity of our planet 
            for future generations.
